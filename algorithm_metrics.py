# In this file there will be a function that takes as input the points of a graph and the path connecting them, and checks if the path is correct.
# Specifically, it checks that:
#  - no node is visited twice,
#  - the path is closed,
#  - all nodes are present,
#  - the nodes are part of the graph.

    This function performs several checks to ensure that the provided path is valid:
    1. The path must be closed (i.e., the first and last nodes must be the same).
    2. The path must contain all the nodes in the graph.
    3. The path must only contain nodes that are present in the graph.
    4. Each node in the path (except for the first and last) must appear only once.

    Parameters:
        points (list): A list of nodes in the graph.
        path (list): A list representing the path to be checked.
